Nearby are miles of hiking/cross-country skiing trails connecting with Quechee State Park along the Ottaquechee River. A new Visitor Center is located at the Gorge.</p>

		</div>
		<p class="tenTop">The Simon Pearce Restaurant was originally established at The Mill in 1983 as the Glassblower's Café, a place where visitors could enjoy lunch overlooking the falls of the Ottauquechee River and its covered bridge. Soon locals discovered the lovely setting and the superb food and the Cafe evolved into the Simon Pearce Restaurant. A terrace dining room overlooking the falls stands open in the summer and is glass-enclosed during winter. The restaurant is acclaimed as one of Vermont's finest, drawing Gourmet Magazine’s highest rating from food critic Peter S. Jennison, who writes, "The coarse Ballymaloe bread that arrives at your table with a crock of sweet butter is, almost alone, worth the trip. We have never been disappointed by the cuisine." House specialties include homemade breads and soups, fresh salads, seafood, Horseradish Crusted Cod and an award-winning wine list.</p>
